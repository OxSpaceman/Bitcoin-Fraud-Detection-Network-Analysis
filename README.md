## üìà Methodology

### Data Exploration & Preprocessing
- Elliptic Dataset: 203,769 transactions with 166 features  
- RobustScaler for handling Bitcoin whale transactions  
- Feature engineering: 94 local + 72 aggregated features  
- Class distribution: 2.2% illicit, 20.6% licit, 77.1% unknown  

### Model Development
- XGBoost with optimal hyperparameters (max_depth=8, n_estimators=500)  
- Class imbalance handling with scale_pos_weight=9.25  
- 5-fold cross-validation for robust evaluation  
- GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization  

### Network Analysis
- Graph connectivity analysis using NetworkX  
- Risk propagation through Bitcoin transaction network  
- Neighbor transaction risk assessment  
- Suspicious cluster identification  

### Risk Assessment System
- 4-tier risk categorization (Safe / Low / Medium / High)  
- Unknown transaction probability scoring  
- Export functionality for investigation teams
